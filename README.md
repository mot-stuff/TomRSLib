# TomRSLib
Tom's Old School RuneScape AHK Library. Contains functions for creating a bot very easily.

Constantly being updated with things I find useful when creating projects. The goal for this library is to be as human-like as possible and to be in a constant state of updating and since it is used in every script I can alter functions more efficiently/create better antiban methods more frequently. 

If you happen to stumble upon this repo congratulations I have not yet released it to the public but I don't mind if people use it. Use this as a learning tool or just to be unethical I don't really mind. Once I quit scripting for good in this language I will publicize this or just let people that are interested enough to learn stumble upon it.
