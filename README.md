# TomRSLib
Tom's Old School RuneScape AHK Library. Contains functions for creating a bot very easily.

Constantly being updated with things I find useful when creating projects. The goal for this library is to be as human-like as possible and to be in a constant state of updating and since it is used in every script I can alter functions more efficiently/create better antiban methods more frequently. 

If you happen to stumble upon this repo congratulations I have not yet released it to the public but I don't mind if people use it. Use this as a learning tool or just to be unethical I don't really mind. Once I quit scripting for good in this language I will publicize this or just let people that are interested enough to learn stumble upon it.


V2 Notes

Improved a lot of things and requires vis2 for the OCR functionality we use. Corrected for a lot of OSRS names so you shouldn't have to mess with much OCR at all for this game. Most of this version is for 100% Resolution scaling either fixed or resizable fixed interface styles with the default skin for the game. It is pretty adjustable and lightweight so can adapt to updates for the game pretty well. Key thing is to find inventory offsets if they change any colors.
